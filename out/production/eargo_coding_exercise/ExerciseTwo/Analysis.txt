1. How to approach problem
    since the input_table and output_table are given,
    what we need to do is to
        1. sum the number of each page
        2. replace ?? with actual record, i.e. update the value in output_table using the previous
    thus, we use sum function to count the total number based on page, then use update sql complete replace step
2. efficient analysis
    we need to scan the total table to get the sum result for replace
